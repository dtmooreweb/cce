# Flower Family Explorer

A web app that pulls data from the [San Francisco Plant Finder API](http://https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Plant-Finder-Data/vmnk-skih "San Francisco Plant Finder API") to display flower family and color relational data.

## Goals

- html/css/js based
- Clean modern design with a friendly inviting style
- Easy to use and understand interface

## Notes

Though this is the type of project I would normally use PHP for the front end formatting, I wanted to dive into it using Javascript.

The main design work went into the "cards" displayed for each search result. At a glance the user can gripe color and size without having to read any text, which makes quick visual scanning of the results easier.

The framework should lend itself to easily add more search/filter parameters - more were not implemented simply in the interest of time. Hopefully the two implemented should give an idea of the functionality.
